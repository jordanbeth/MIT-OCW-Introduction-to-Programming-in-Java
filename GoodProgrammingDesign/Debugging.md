# Debugging

### 1. Don't Make Mistakes
* Do NOT introduce errors in the first place
  - __**Reuse**__: find existing code that does what you want
  - __**Design**__: think before you code - **Pseudocode**
  - __**Best Practices__: Recommended procedures / techniques to avoid common problems

---

## Pseudocode
* A high-level, understandable description of what a program is supposed to do
* Focus on structure, NOT details
  + __**example problem**__: Is a number within the interval [x, y)?
  + __**pseudocode__ :
     - If number < x return false
     - If number >= y return false
     - Return true
